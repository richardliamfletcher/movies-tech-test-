Hello 

This includes two react routed pages one for for each api.

This was created by modifying a simple create react app. Please run npm or npx install to gain the prerequisites then hit npm start. 

I have placed most of my effort into the movies section 
Features: 
    - List of movies coming back from the api, with pictures and toggable information.
    - Name search.
    - Dynamic gener filter.
    - Random movie generator, selects one of the movies at random.
    - Clear filters button. 

Time series section just takes the data from the api and displays it in boxes.

Things to improve
  - Do more with the time series api.
  - Perhaps add a little more to the styling. 

Thanks for reviewing,
Richard
